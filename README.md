## Marlin 2.0 Blackfyre Edition

This is my spin on the Marlin firmware for my setup:
 - Ender 3 with the BTT E3 DIP Board (yes, the 1.0 supports 512 Kb Flash)
 - BL Touch with the Creality metal bracket for it (On the Z endstop pin, for now)
 - Filament run-out sensor
 - **Thermal run away protection enabled**

I'm keeping this fork relative up to date.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
